# Python Setup #

Support for regular Python is offered by the example(s) in this folder.

### Instructions ###
(1) Install <a href="https://micropython.org/download/">Python</a> on your device using your preferred method. (PySerial needs Python 3.4+)

(2) `pip install pyserial` to install PySerial on your computer (if you have not already done so).

(3) Plug in the Trifecta IMU device using USB cable.

(4) Copy the contents of this folder to your file system and run `python example_serial_main.py` to test the connection.

### Notes ###

For now, wireless IMU operation is not supported, but this is planned in the future.
